				<h2>Early Life</h2>
				<p>Edward Thomas Hardy was born on September 15, 1977, in Hammersmith, London, England. The only child of
					comedy and novel writer Edward Hardy and artist mother Anne, Hardy suffered from alcoholism, drug
					addiction and delinquency during his teen and early adult years.

					Despite his demons, Hardy went on to pursue acting at the Richmond Drama School and the prestigious Drama
					Centre London. His intense commitment fine-tuned Hardy's acting skills. In a <span><a
							href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/12/09/an-interview-with-tom-hardy" target="_blank">2002
							interview with
							IGN</a></span> </span> , the actor stated, "When other schools would be doing, sort of, 30 hours,
					we were doing 60. And we'd
					be doing stuff that would prepare you in a very different way."</p>

				<h2>TV, Film and Theater Success

				<h2>'Bronson,' 'Wuthering Heights,' 'Inception'</h2>
				<p>In 2008, Hardy was cast in a unique role as a gay hoodlum in the film RocknRolla, directed by Guy
					Ritchie, and won a British Independent Film Award (best actor) for his turn as Britain's most violent
					prisoner in Bronson. He tackled playing Heathcliffe in Wuthering Heights the following year, and gained
					more fame for his portrayal of Eames in Inception (2010), a surrealist blockbuster helmed by

				<p>In the summer of 2012, Hardy starred as a bootlegging brother in the Depression-era drama Lawless and as
					Batman's nemesis Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. He appeared as Alfie Solomons in the British gangster
					series Peaky Blinders, which premiered in 2014, before landing the headlining role of the much-lauded Mad

				<h2>'The Revenant'</h2>

				<h2>'Taboo,' 'Venom'</h2>
				<p>Hardy returned to the small screen in 2017 in the British series Taboo, which he co-created with his
					father and Steven Knight. The following year, he starred as the titular anti-hero of the Spider-Man
					spinoff Venom, a film that drew a middling response from critics but performed well enough at the box
					office to send a sequel into production.</p>

			<article id="5">
				<h2>Personal Life</h2>
				<p>Hardy has a child, son Louis Thomas Hardy (born on April 8, 2008), with ex-girlfriend Rachel Speed. In
					1999, he married Sarah Ward; the couple parted ways in 2004. Hardy blames his drug habit for the split,
					after which he spent time in rehab to recover.

					Hardy married English actress Charlotte Riley in 2014. The couple welcomed their first child together in
					2015 and another baby in late 2018.

					In 2018, the actor was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to drama.
